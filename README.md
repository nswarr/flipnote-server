Installation
------------
First, you need git, duh.

> sudo apt-get install git

Then, clone this repo.

> git clone https://bitbucket.org/nswarr/flipnote-server

Then, go into the directory of the app you just cloned and just execute make.

> sudo make

That installs all of the dependencies you need.  To start the application, just execute the following command from the application directory.

> grunt

This builds and starts the app.  It also detects changes and rebuilds the app on the fly.
